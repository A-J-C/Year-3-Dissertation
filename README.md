# Year-3-Dissertation
3rd Year Project

Project on comparing the progress of attacks against ECC and RSA. There is a variety of code here that is (should be?) fully documented. 
Clicking into the Jupyter Notebooks you can see the main results of the project.

This repo is for personal use and so isn't set-up for someone forking the code, however if interested please contact me at alexcraig.linkedin@gmail.com
